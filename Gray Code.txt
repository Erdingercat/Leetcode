The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:

00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
Note:
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.

For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> result;
        
        if(n == 0){
            result.push_back(0);
            return result;
        }
        
        vector<int> prev = grayCode(n-1);
        
        result.insert(result.end(), prev.begin(), prev.end());
        
        for(vector<int>::iterator it = prev.end()-1; it >= prev.begin(); it--){
            int tmp = 1 << n-1;
            result.push_back((*it)+tmp);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
